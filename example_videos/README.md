# Guide to example videos

There are three videos in this folder. Each are provided in `.mp4` format and as a MATLAB variable `vid` in a `.mat` file.

1. Magnetically tethered (body-free) fly
2. Rigidly tethered (body-fixed) fly
3. Rigidly tethered (body-fixed) fly with higher-contrast lighting, required to estimate head roll from one camera view

The sub-folders contain the kinematic tracking data (body, head, abdomen kinematics) and registered videos generated by **CrazyFly**. Note that the registered videos in the `reigistered` sub-folder also have corresponding head and abdomen tracking data folders.
